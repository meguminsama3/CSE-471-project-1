#### Score file format: XML
* The root tag is the score tag that contains values of **“bpm”** (beats per minute) and **“beatspermeasure”**.
* Inside the score tag are the instrument tags that specify the **names of the instruments**.
* Inside each instrument tag, there are **note** tags that contains the values of:
  * At what **measure** the note should be played
  * At what **beat** in that measure the note should be played
  * **How long** the note should last in beats
  * The **pitch** of the note
* Inside the note tag, there are two **harmonics** tags: 
  * The first one is **harmonicsA**. It specifies the different amplitudes of the sine wave for different harmonics for harmonic set A.  
  * The second one is **harmonicsB**. It specifies the different amplitudes of the sine wave for different harmonics for harmonic set B.
